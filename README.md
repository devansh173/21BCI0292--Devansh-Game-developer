Guide Doofus to walk on as many Pulpits as possible without falling.

Pulpits have a timer and disappear after a random time interval.

Only two Pulpits can exist simultaneously. A new Pulpit appears adjacent to the previous one after the timer of the previous Pulpit reaches a certain time.
Controls

Arrow Keys or WASD to move Doofus:

Left Arrow / A: Move left

Right Arrow / D: Move right

Up Arrow / W: Move up

Down Arrow / S: Move down

Scoring

Score increases by 1 point for each Pulpit Doofus successfully steps on.

The game ends when Doofus falls off a platform or is on a disappearing Pulpit.

Game Mechanics

Pulpits are green platforms with a random lifetime between 10 to 20 seconds.

A new Pulpit appears when the timer of the previous one reaches a certain threshold.

If Doofus is not on a Pulpit when a check is performed, the game is over.
